Odin JS Project #1 - Rock, Paper, Scissors


## This is my first JS project

MY task is to make a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

I said simple, but it may not be the case, regardless.

## Happy Coding!

## Aftermath

Finally, it was so hard.

I have commented my learnings in the script file but hears some of it:

--- I learned scoping variables
--- Learned a lot about conditionals 
--- Had to advance the lessons to get into loops here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code.

I know I'm not supposed to step into rabbit holes, I'll just go back.

Anyways, I think I finished the project, hopefully.
