Odin JS Project #1 - Rock, Paper, Scissors


## This is my first JS project

MY task is to make a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

I said simple, but it may not be the case, regardless.

## Happy Coding!

## Aftermath

Finally, it was so hard.

I have commented my learnings in the script file but hears some of it:

--- I learned scoping variables
--- Learned a lot about conditionals 
--- Had to advance the lessons to get into loops here.

I know I'm not supposed to step into rabbit holes, I'll just go back.

Anyways, I think I finished the project, hopefully.


## Revisiting rock, paper, scissors

It was so hard, got stuck for 2 weeks, and eventually caved in and asked for help at TOP discord community. After some Socratic dialogue @gin was able to make me see, how I can approach the project.

Doing the Best of Five Game, I've learned:

--- Events automatically create event objects, which can then be used as an argument for a function.

--- Function parameters can be passed regardless of name as long as it is still referring to the same value.

--- Events can have many event listeners.

Now the game can be played, but it still looks booooooring, we should give it some style. See ya, later!


## Added CSS

--- I made it look like a football (or any other sports) game Scoreboard

--- I saw some cool way to style buttons from this guy on YouTube, check him out! => https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT

--- The icons I got from: https://fontawesome.com/
