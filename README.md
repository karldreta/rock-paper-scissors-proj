# Rock-Paper-Scissors Project

## Overview

This is my first JavaScript project from Odin's curriculum: a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. While it may seem straightforward, it presented some interesting challenges.

## Getting Started

### Project Objective

Create a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript.

## My Journey

### Challenges and Learnings

Developing this project was quite a challenge. Here's what I learned:

- **Variable Scoping:** Gained understanding of scoping variables.
- **Conditionals:** Worked extensively with conditional statements.
- **Loops:** Advanced lessons were necessary to implement loops.

I encountered difficulties and found myself exploring areas beyond the project scope. I eventually sought help from the TOP Discord community and, through Socratic dialogue with **@gin**, gained new insights into approaching the project.

### Key Takeaways

While implementing the Best of Five Game, I learned:

- **Event Objects:** Events automatically create event objects that can be used as function arguments.
- **Function Parameters:** Parameters can be passed by value, regardless of their names.
- **Multiple Event Listeners:** Multiple event listeners can be attached to a single event.

The game now works, but it's in need of some styling.

## Styling and Enhancements

### CSS Improvements

- Styled the game to resemble a sports scoreboard.
- Found inspiration for button styling from a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT).
- Used fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Integrated icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Conclusion

The project was challenging but rewarding. I'm happy with the outcome and excited to continue enhancing my skills. See you later!
